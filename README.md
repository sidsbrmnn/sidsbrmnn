I'm Siddharth, a 25-year-old avid tech geek and a full stack engineer, based out
of Flagstaff, Arizona. I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at
Northern Arizona University. I previously worked on 
[Zmanda](https://www.zmanda.com), an enterprise backup and recovery solution, at
[BETSOL](https://github.com/BetsolLLC) as a Build/Release and DevOps Engineer.
