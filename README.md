## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Siddharth, a 23-year-old avid tech geek and a full stack engineer, based out
of Bengaluru, India. I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at
Northern Arizona University. I previously worked on 
[Zmanda](https://www.zmanda.com), an enterprise backup and recovery solution, at
[BETSOL](https://github.com/BetsolLLC) as a Build/Release and DevOps Engineer.

### What am I upto lately?

- :seedling: Trying to get my hands dirty with some Shell scripting.
- :computer: Recent projects: [Hackwell 2.0](https://hackwell.vercel.app), 
[Tachyon Motorsport](https://www.tachyonmotorsport.com),
[Bolo Meet](https://bolomeet.com).
