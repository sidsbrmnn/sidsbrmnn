# Hi there, I'm Siddharth ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Engineer based in Flagstaff, Arizona, with a strong passion for building scalable, high-performance applications. I recently earned my Master of Science in Computer Science from Northern Arizona University in December 2024. My academic journey focused on large-scale data structures, high-performance computing, and open-source software development. My thesis explored the impact of software architecture when integrating Generative AI in Unity-based games.

Previously, I worked as an Associate Software Engineer at [BETSOL](https://www.betsol.com), where I focused on full stack development, Linux package management, and DevOps for [Zmanda](https://www.zmanda.com), an enterprise backup and recovery solution. My role involved optimizing CI/CD pipelines, enhancing TLS security, and improving system efficiency. Beyond my professional work, I actively maintain open-source projects, including [ScrollSpy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrollspy) and [JWT Decode](https://pub.dev/packages/jwt_decode), both of which have been widely adopted by developers worldwide.

Currently, I'm exploring new opportunities and projects, particularly in full stack or backend engineering. Some of my recent work includes contributions to [Homero](https://heyhomero.com), [Hackwell](https://hackwell.vercel.app), and [Tachyon Motorsport](https://tachyonmotorsport.vercel.app). I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.
